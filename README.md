# Thermostat Challenge

As part of week 6 at Makeres Academy, we've been challenged to create a thermostat web app using JavaScript. This is the first week we've used JavaScript, as for the past several weeks we've been learning and using Ruby. Bit of a steep learning curve, but following the same basic TDD approach with Jasmine, we're hoping to make it work!

The following user stories have been made from challenge specifications.

## User Story 1

```
As a person,
So I can know the temperature,
I would like a thermostat that starts at 20 degrees.
```

## User Story 2

```
As a person,
So I can be warmer/colder,
I want to change the thermostat with an up/down function.
```

## User Story 3

```
As a person,
So my house doesn't actually freeze,
I want the minimum temperature to be 10.
```

## User Story 4

I want power saving mode to max out at 25.
```

## User Story 5

```

## User Story 8

```

So I can check my energy usage,
I want to check the thermostat's current energy usage.
(< 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage)
```
